      "Cricket, a bat-and-ball game where two teams of eleven players compete, has its origins in England and has grown in popularity globally, notably in India, Australia, and Pakistan. Matches are divided into innings with one team batting to score runs and the other bowling and fielding with the aim to dismiss batsmen. Played on a circular or oval field with a central 22-yard pitch, cricket offers various formats including Test matches that can span up to five days, One Day Internationals (ODIs) limited to 50 overs per side, and the fast-paced Twenty20 (T20) with 20 overs per side. Key terminologies in the game include a ‘century,’ which denotes a score of 100 runs, a ‘duck’ for a batsman's score of zero, and a ‘hat-trick’ achieved when a bowler takes three wickets in consecutive deliveries. Governed globally by the International Cricket Council (ICC), cricket continues to fascinate and engage millions of fans around the world.\n"

      "Here are three potential solutions you can try:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Restart in Safe Mode:**\n",
      "   - Restart your laptop and press the F8 key (or the key specific to your laptop model) before the Windows logo appears.\n",
      "   - Select \"Safe Mode\" and see if your laptop starts up without showing the blue screen.\n",
      "   - If it does, you can troubleshoot further from there, such as running antivirus software or checking for driver issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **System Restore:**\n",
      "   - Restart your laptop and press the F8 key again to go to the Advanced Boot Options menu.\n",
      "   - Choose \"Repair Your Computer\" and then \"System Restore.\"\n",
      "   - Select a restore point from a date when your laptop was working fine and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the restore process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Check for Hardware Issues:**\n",
      "   - Ensure that all external devices (USB drives, printers, etc.) are disconnected and see if the problem persists.\n",
      "   - Open the laptop to check if the RAM and hard drive are properly seated. Sometimes, reseating these components can solve the problem.\n",
      "   - If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, consider taking your laptop to a professional for a hardware diagnostic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please give these solutions a try and let us know if any of them resolve the issue. We would greatly appreciate your feedback to improve our support services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for reaching out, and we hope your laptop issue gets resolved soon!\n"
